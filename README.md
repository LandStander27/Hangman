# Hangman
Simple hangman

Add or remove words by editing the "words.json" file (Follow the format)

Exmaples - If you want to add the words "bob" and "great" (assuming there isn't anything in the file already), you would type "["bob", "great"]" without the outer quotes

Lets say that the default words in the file are "bob" and "great" and you want to add "talk", write "["bob", "great", "talk"]"

NOT CASE SENSITIVE
